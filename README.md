Welcome to Guild Wars Archivist, one of the largest databases of Guild Wars 1 PvP matches.

## About

Guild Wars Archivist is a platform for preserving and analyzing Guild Wars 1 competitive PvP data. Our database contains detailed match information for recent matches, but is able to perform large-scale statistics on historical data regarding player and guild performances.

## What Can Players Do

- **Browse Matches**: Filter through matches by competitions, players, guilds, and custom criteria
- **Personal Statistics**: Link all your pseudos to a username to access your complete match history and performance stats
- **Guild & Build Analysis**: Study the biggest guilds and most successful build concepts
- **3D Match Visualization** *(coming soon)*: Experience matches in an entirely new way with 3D renders viewable directly on the website. Learn more in [`docs/observer-lite.md`](docs/observer-lite.md)
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor your progress and compare with top players
